## Welcome

Welcome to Data 145! When we learn about the world from data, how much can we
rely on the conclusions we draw? How do we know if we could do better?

This course covers the statistical theory required to measure and control our
uncertainty when we analyze large and complex modern data sets. We will use
mathematical and computational lenses to examine optimality properties and
error bounds. The class will be fast-paced and math-intensive. Students will
be expected to learn independently and participate actively in all lecture
and discussion sessions.
