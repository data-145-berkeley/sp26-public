This page outlines the policies and expectations for Data 145. Please read this
carefully and refer back as needed throughout the semester.

## Grading

Your grade will be determined by the following components:

| Component | Weight | Notes |
|:----------|-------:|:------|
| Problem Sets | 40% | 6 problem sets, lowest score dropped |
| Quizzes | 10% | Weekly in-class quizzes, lowest 2 dropped |
| Midterm Exam | 20% | Thursday, March 6 (in class) |
| Final Exam | 25% | Date TBD |
| Participation | 5% | Discussion section attendance and engagement |

### Letter Grades

Final letter grades will be assigned based on overall performance. We do not
use a fixed curve; if everyone demonstrates mastery of the material, everyone
can earn high grades. Typical grade boundaries are approximately:

- A/A-: 90-100%
- B+/B/B-: 80-89%
- C+/C/C-: 70-79%
- D: 60-69%
- F: Below 60%

We reserve the right to adjust these boundaries based on overall class
performance.

## Problem Sets

- **Release**: Problem sets are released on the [course website](schedule.qmd)
  each week
- **Submission**: Submit on **Gradescope** by the deadline (typically Thursday
  at 11:59pm)
- **Format**: Submit a single PDF. We recommend LaTeX, but neatly handwritten
  and scanned solutions are acceptable
- **Lowest score**: Your lowest problem set score will be dropped

### Late Policy

- **Slip days**: You have **3 slip days** for the semester, which can be used
  on any problem set
- **Usage**: Slip days are applied automatically; no need to notify us
- **Maximum**: At most 2 slip days can be used on any single assignment
- **After slip days**: Late submissions receive 0 credit unless you have
  documentation for an extenuating circumstance

## Collaboration Policy

We encourage you to work together and learn from each other! However, there are
important boundaries:

### Permitted

- Discussing concepts and approaches with classmates
- Working through examples together
- Explaining ideas to each other
- Using course materials (lectures, notes, textbooks)
- Getting help in office hours

### Not Permitted

- Copying solutions from classmates (even if you worked together)
- Sharing written solutions before the deadline
- Using solutions from previous semesters
- Using AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to generate solutions
- Posting problems or solutions online

### Write-Up Rule

**You must write up your solutions independently.** Even if you discussed a
problem with classmates, your final written solution must be your own work,
written in your own words, without looking at anyone else's solution.

**Citation**: If you received substantial help on a problem (from a classmate,
TA, or other source), please note this in your submission.

## Academic Integrity

We take academic integrity seriously. Violations will be reported to the
Center for Student Conduct and may result in:

- Zero on the assignment
- Failing grade in the course
- Notation on your academic record

If you're unsure whether something is allowed, please ask! We're happy to
clarify.

## Exams

- **Closed book**: No notes, books, or electronic devices
- **Calculator**: No calculators (problems will not require one)
- **Conflicts**: If you have a conflict with an exam date, notify us within
  the first two weeks of the semester
- **Accommodations**: Students with DSP accommodations should provide their
  letters as early as possible

## Regrades

- **Deadline**: Regrade requests must be submitted within **one week** of
  receiving your score
- **How**: Submit a regrade request on Gradescope with a clear explanation
- **Note**: We may regrade the entire assignment, which could result in a
  lower score

## Attendance

- **Lectures**: Not mandatory, but highly recommended. Lectures cover material
  not always in the textbook
- **Discussion sections**: Attendance is expected and counts toward participation
- **Quizzes**: Given in class; you must be present to take them (we drop the
  lowest 2)

## Accessibility and Accommodations

We are committed to making this course accessible to all students:

- **DSP accommodations**: Please provide your accommodation letters as early as
  possible so we can make appropriate arrangements
- **Other needs**: If you have any concerns about accessibility, please talk to
  us. We want to help you succeed
- **Mental health**: Your wellbeing matters. If you're struggling, please reach
  out. UC Berkeley has resources including the [Tang Center](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/mental-health)

## Communication

- **Ed Discussion**: Use for all course-related questions. We aim to respond
  within 24 hours
- **Email**: Use only for private matters (grades, personal circumstances)
- **Office hours**: The best place to get help with problem sets and concepts
