## Computing

This course uses Python for computational work. Here's how to get set up:

### Option 1: DataHub (Recommended for Beginners)

UC Berkeley provides [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), a cloud-based
Jupyter environment. No installation required!

1. Go to [datahub.berkeley.edu](https://datahub.berkeley.edu)
2. Log in with your CalNet ID
3. You're ready to go!

### Option 2: Local Installation

If you prefer to work locally:

1. **Install Anaconda**: Download from [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. **Launch Jupyter**: Open Anaconda Navigator and click "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook
3. **Required packages**: Most are included with Anaconda. We'll use:
   - `numpy` - numerical computing
   - `pandas` - data manipulation
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - visualization
   - `scipy` - statistical functions
